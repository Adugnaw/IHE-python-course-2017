# IHE-python-course-2017
Material for the extracurricular python course given at UNESCO-IHE from 21-Feb-2017

Upon reques of the virtually entire student community studying at UNESCO-IHE in Delft in 2017, an extracurricular course on Python was given as it was realize that learning python is an essential asset for futur engineers and scientists.

The material used is borrowed from the internet, github, especially Prof. Mark Bakker's tutorials that are used to teach Python all 2nd year students of Civil Enginering and Geoscientists of TUDelft.

Whenever useful we may also borrow examples and material elsewhere for practicing as long as the material is publicly available for use by the students.
