# IHE-python-course-2017
Material for the extracurricular python course given at UNESCO-IHE from 21-Feb-2017

Upon request of the virtually entire student community studying at UNESCO-IHE in Delft in 2017, an extracurricular course on Python was given as it was realized that learning python is an essential asset for future engineers and scientists.

Next to my own exercises, we'll borrow much of the exercises Prof. Mark Bakker's tutorials for all students at the faculty of CEGS at TUDelft, which are availalbe on github. Other material from the internet may also be used.

The focus is on the needs of scientists and engineers.

The students are supposed to install the Anaconda packages on their laptop and the lessons will be on Tuesdays 16:45-17:30 as from Feb 21, 2017 in the auditorium of IHE at the Westvest in Delft.

For your own practicing I advice the exercises in the book (2015) **"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"** by Al Sweigart. The book can be read free on the Internet. The excercises are as simple as possible, systematically aranged, in each step explaining one new aspect, everything in it is extremely clearly explained and the book is even relaxed reading. Each chapter ends with a set of questions and one or two practical projects that are interesting and useful by themselves. In one word, the book is a wealth. I assume that students will do such exercises themselves, so that we can taken Python a step further in class.

**Feb 21:**
Introduction, see ppt presentation on this site.
MB's first notebook was used as a start thereafter. Basic plotting of polynomicals using matplotlib.pyplot and numpy. The resulting notebook is on this site.

**Feb 28**
This time we'll heavily focus on tuples, lists, dicts and sets. We will read data from an excel workbook, turn this into dicts. We'll make heavily use of the list, dict and set comprehensions to generate the lists and dict that we need to order, join, analyze and visualize the results from the data that we have read in from different sheets of the excel workbook. Hence there will be quite some advanced working with sequences, iterators and generators so that afterwards you should feel comfortable with them.
