    "Last week we focused on the essential tools in Python, i.e tuples, lists, dicts and sets. Strings are another such tool, but strings become essentially effective if combined with reading files and lists, dicts and set. That's whey we postponed this subject to this week, allowing us more handling space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already mentioned that strings are immutable sequences of characters. So we can't replace individual characters or change them from uppercase to lowercase, nor can't we append characters, but we can replace an old string by a new one, and while doing so apply the required changes. So immutability is never a big issue, on the contrary immutability allows using strings as keys in dicts, which is a game changing advantage.\n",
